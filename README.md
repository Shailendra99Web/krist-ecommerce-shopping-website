# Krist | Shopping Ecommerce Website — Figma → Full Stack Web Develpoment (MERN Stack)

I translated the **Krist | Ecommerce Shopping Website** Figma concept into MERN Stack.  
This repo is a learning / Full Stack Ecommerce project's Frontend Part to practice DOM manipulation, scalability, and layout translation from Figma.
